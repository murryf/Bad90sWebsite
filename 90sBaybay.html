                    Bowling is a target sport and recreational activity in 
                    which a player rolls a ball toward pins (in pin bowling) 
                    or another target (in target bowling).

                <p style="color: yellow; background-color: blue;">    
                    In pin bowling, the goal is to knock over pins on a long 
                    playing surface known as a lane. Lanes have a wood or synthetic 
                    surface onto which protective lubricating oil is applied in 
                    different specified oil patterns that affect ball motion. A 
                    strike is achieved when all the pins are knocked down on the 
                    first roll, and a spare is achieved if all the pins are knocked 
                    over on a second roll. Common types of pin bowling include 
                    ten-pin, candlepin, duckpin, nine-pin, and five-pin. The historical 
                    game skittles is the forerunner of modern pin bowling.
